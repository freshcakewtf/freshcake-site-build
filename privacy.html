    <h1>Your Data is Safe. Mostly Because I Don’t Want It.</h1>
    <p>Let’s cut to the chase: I’m not snooping, creeping, or collecting your life story. Also, this page looks like ass. Fresh Cake is all about spreading smiles, not spreadsheets of personal info.</p>
    <p>So, what *am* I doing? I take a curious peek at which GIFs and stickers get the most love and the key words that make people go, “Yep, that’s the one!” It’s like peering at the dessert table to see which cupcakes get eaten first. Why? So I can whip up even more deliciously fun animations just for you.</p>
    <p>No selling. No sharing. No shady stuff. Just me, your friendly neighborhood animator, figuring out how to keep things quirky, cool, and full of laughs.</p>
    <p>If that sounds good, stick around. If not, well…at least you’ve got excellent taste in GIFs. 😉</p>
